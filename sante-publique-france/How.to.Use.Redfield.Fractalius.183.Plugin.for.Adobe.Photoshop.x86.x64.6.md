Once you open the plugin window, you will see a preview of your image with the default settings applied. You can use the sliders on the right side of the window to adjust the parameters of the plugin. Here are some of the main parameters and what they do:
 
- **Radius**: This controls the size of the fractals. A higher value will create larger and more visible fractals.
- **Sharpness**: This controls the contrast and clarity of the fractals. A higher value will create sharper and more defined fractals.
- **Line Thickness**: This controls the thickness of the lines that form the fractals. A higher value will create thicker and more prominent lines.
- **Line Brightness**: This controls the brightness of the lines that form the fractals. A higher value will create brighter and more vivid lines.
- **Color**: This controls the color of the lines that form the fractals. You can choose from a range of colors or use the original color of the image.
- **Smoothness**: This controls the smoothness of the edges of the fractals. A higher value will create smoother and more blended edges.
- **Variation**: This controls the randomness and diversity of the fractals. A higher value will create more varied and complex fractals.

You can also use the buttons on the bottom of the window to apply different presets that have predefined settings for different effects. For example, you can use "Sketch" to create a sketch-like effect, "Glow" to create a glowing effect, or "Fire" to create a fire-like effect.
 
You can also use the "Randomize" button to generate random settings and see what results you get. You can also use the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to undo or redo your changes.
 
When you are satisfied with your settings, you can click on "OK" to apply them to your image. You can then save your image or continue editing it in Adobe Photoshop.
